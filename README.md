# graph-tool_pydna

This repository contains the code necessary to convert a NetworkX graph into a Graph-tool graph. (Assembly module)  
I also had to adapt another module called simple_paths.  
This is part of a project of my Masters in Bioinformatics where I had to improve the efficiency of Pydna by implementing Graph-tool in place of NetworkX.  
While I was capable of fully implementing Graph-tool , there werent't any improvements in efficiency.  
The .py files within this folder contain the tools necessary for profiling and timing of the code, so replication of the process should be trivial.  
A pdf report is also included where I discuss my work and my results.
