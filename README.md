# graph-tool_pydna

This repository contains the code necessary to convert a NetworkX graph into a Graph-tool graph. (Assembly module)  
I also had to adapt another module called simple_paths.  
This is part of a project of my Masters in Bioinformatics where I had to improve the efficiency of Pydna by implementing Graph-tool in place of NetworkX.  
While I was capable of fully implementing Graph-tool , there werent't any improvements in efficiency.  
At a later date, a report will be published where I discuss my work and my results.
